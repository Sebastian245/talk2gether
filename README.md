Language Exchange System

Language Exchange System

This project serves as my thesis for my Information Systems Engineering degree. It is a language exchange system designed to facilitate language learning and practice between users. The system leverages Java Spring Boot for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and integrates with Jitsi Meet API and CometChat API for real-time communication features. Additionally, MySQL is employed for data storage, and Firebase Storage caters to file storage requirements.
    
-User Authentication: Secure user authentication and authorization system.  
-Profile Management: Users can create and manage their profiles, including language preferences and proficiency levels.  
-Language Exchange Matching: Algorithm to match users based on their language preferences and proficiency levels for exchange sessions.  
-Real-time Communication: Integration with Jitsi Meet API and CometChat API for real-time video, voice, and text communication between users.    
-File Storage: Integration with Firebase Storage for storing files such as user profile pictures, documents, etc.   
-Messaging: Users can communicate via text messages within the platform.
